# Maps

<p style="align: center;">This repository is all about Maps. :earth_africa: :heart:</p>

It's an archive of my developments with maps and various technologies.

Currently I'm playing around with [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) and [PubNub](http://pubnub.com) for
real-time location tracking.

Since I'm highly insterested in IOT devices and infrastructues I'm playing a little bit with an[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)  with an Ethernet Shield and sensors.  


There will be a lot of [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com) + [MapBox](http://mapbox.com) stuff here too.



# Examples

* [PubNub Publish on Arduino with Ethernet](https://github.com/moritzhckr/Maps/tree/master/Pubnub%20Arduino/PubNub_Publish_ArduinoEthernet)
* [PubNub datastream with Mapbox Map ](https://github.com/moritzhckr/Maps/tree/master/Pubnub%20Mapbox/Map%20w_%20Subscribtion)
